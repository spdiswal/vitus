# This workflow implements one of the final stages of the release pipeline.
# It publishes the package to the npm registry: https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitus
#
# It is triggered by pushing a Git tag with a `v` prefix, as done by the `publish-tag.yml` workflow.
#
# It can be triggered manually via the GitHub CLI:
#   gh workflow run publish-npm.yml --ref <tag-name>
#   gh run watch
#
# It can also be triggered manually via the GitHub web interface:
#   https://github.com/spdiswal/vitus/actions/workflows/publish-npm.yml
